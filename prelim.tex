\section{Notations}

The distance between two points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ will be denoted by $\dist{x}{y}{}$ or $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$.
The latter notation is used if we need to emphasize 
that the distance is taken in the space~${\spc{X}}$.

We will denote by $\SSS^n$, $\EE^n$, and $\HH^n$ the $n$-dimensional sphere (with angle metric), 
Euclidean space, and Lobachevsky space respectively.
More generally, $\MM^n(\kappa)$ will denote the \emph{model $n$-space} of curvature $\kappa$;
that is,
\begin{itemize}
\item if $\kappa>0$, then $\MM^n(\kappa)$ is the $n$-sphere of radius $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa}}$, so $\SSS^n=\MM^n(1)$
\item $\MM^n(0)=\EE^n$,
\item if $\kappa<0$, then $\MM^n(\kappa)$ is the Lobachevsky $n$-space $\HH^n$ rescaled by factor $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{-\kappa}}$;
in particular $\MM^n(-1)=\HH^n$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Completion}

Given a metric space $\spc{X}$, 
consider the set $\spc{C}$ of all Cauchy sequences in $\spc{X}$.
Note that for any two Cauchy sequences $(x_n)$ and $(y_n)$ the right-hand side in \ref{eq:cauchy-dist} is defined;
moreover, it defines a semimetric on~$\spc{C}$
\[\dist{(x_n)}{(y_n)}{\spc{C}}\df\lim_{n\to\infty}\dist{x_n}{y_n}{\spc{X}}.\eqlbl{eq:cauchy-dist}\]
The corresponding metric space is called the \index{completion}\emph{completion} of $\spc{X}$;
it will be denoted by $\bar{\spc{X}}$.

It is straightforward to check that \textit{completion is complete.}
  
For each point $x\in\spc{X}$, one can consider a constant sequence $x_n=x$ which is Cauchy.
It defines a natural inclusion map $\spc{X}\hookrightarrow \bar{\spc{X}}$.
It is easy to check that this map is distance-preserving.
In particular, we can (and will) consider $\spc{X}$ as a subset of $\bar{\spc{X}}$.
Note that \textit{$\spc{X}$ is a dense subset in its completion $\bar{\spc{X}}$}.

\section{Length and length spaces}\label{sec:length}

The definitions stated in the previous section can be applied to any metric space.
However, interesting things happen only for the so-called \textit{geodesic} or at least \textit{length spaces} that we  are going to define now.

\parbf{Length.}
A \index{curve}\emph{curve} is defined as a continuous map from a real interval $\II$ to a metric space.
If $\II=[0,1]$, then the curve is called a \index{path}\emph{path}.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and
$\alpha\: \II\to \spc{X}$ be a curve.
We define the \index{length}\emph{length} of $\alpha$ as 
\[
\length \alpha \df \sup_{t_0\le t_1\le\ldots\le t_n}\sum_i \dist{\alpha(t_i)}{\alpha(t_{i-1})}{}.
\]

A curve $\alpha$ is called \index{rectifiable curve}\emph{rectifiable} if $\length \alpha<\infty$.
\end{thm}

The following theorem is assumed to be known;
see \cite{petrunin2023pure,burago-burago-ivanov}.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:length-semicont}
Length is a lower semi-continuous with respect to the pointwise convergence of curves. 

More precisely, assume that a sequence
of curves $\gamma_n\:\II\to \spc{X}$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ converges pointwise 
to a curve $\gamma_\infty\:\II\to \spc{X}$;
that is, for any fixed $t \in \II$ we have $\gamma_n(t)\z\to\gamma_\infty(t)$ as $n\to\infty$. 
Then 
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty} \length\gamma_n \ge \length\gamma_\infty.\eqlbl{eq:semicont-length}$$
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{20 mm}
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-100}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the inequality \ref{eq:semicont-length} might be strict.
For example, the diagonal $\gamma_\infty$ of the unit square 
can be  approximated by stairs-like
polygonal curves $\gamma_n$
with sides parallel to the sides of the square ($\gamma_6$ is on the picture).
In this case
\[\length\gamma_\infty=\sqrt{2}\quad
\text{and}\quad \length\gamma_n=2\]
for any $n$.

\parbf{Length spaces.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.
If for any $\eps>0$ and any pair of points $x,y\in\spc{X}$, there is a path $\alpha$ connecting $x$ to $y$ such that
\[\length\alpha< \dist{x}{y}{}+\eps,\]
then $\spc{X}$ is called a \index{length space}\emph{length space} and the metric on $\spc{X}$ is called a \index{length metric}\emph{length metric}.\label{page:length metric}

Evidently, any geodesic space is a length space.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact-length}
Show that any compact length space is geodesic.
\end{thm}


\parbf{Induced length metric.}
Directly from the definition, it follows that if $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ is a path from $x$ to $y$ 
(that is, $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$), then 
\[\length\alpha\ge \dist{x}{y}{}.\]
Set 
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\inf\{\,\length\alpha\,\}\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken for all paths from $x$ to~$y$.
It is straightforward to check that $(x,y)\mapsto \yetdist{x}{y}{}$ is an \emph{$\infty$-metric};
that is, $(x,y)\mapsto \yetdist{x}{y}{}$ is a metric in the extended positive reals $[0,\infty]$. 
The metric $\yetdist{*}{*}{}$ is called the \index{induced length metric}\emph{induced length metric}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact+connceted}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete length space.
Show that for any compact subset $K\subset\spc{X}$
there is a compact path-connected subset $K'\subset\spc{X}$ that contains $K$.  
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:compact=>complete}
Suppose $(\spc{X},\dist{*}{*}{})$ is a complete metric space.
Show that $(\spc{X},\yetdist{*}{*}{})$ is complete.
\end{thm}

Let $A$ be a subset of a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Given two points $x,y\in A$,
consider the value
\[\dist{x}{y}{A}=\inf_{\alpha}\{\,\length\alpha\,\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in~$A$.
In other words, $\dist{*}{*}{A}$ denotes the induced length metric on the subspace $A$.
(The notation $\dist{*}{*}{A}$ conflicts with the previously defined notation for distance $\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$.
However, most of the time we will work with ambient length spaces where the meaning will be unambiguous.)

\section{Geodesics and triangles}

\parbf{Geodesics.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $\II$\index{$\II$} a real interval. 
A distance-preserving map $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is called a \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesic}%
\footnote{Others call it differently: \textit{shortest path}, \textit{minimizing geodesic}.
Also, note that the meaning of the term \textit{geodesic} is different from what is used in Riemannian geometry, altho they are closely related.}; 
in other words, $\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a geodesic if 
\[\dist{\gamma(s)}{\gamma(t)}{\spc{X}}=|s-t|\]
for any pair $s,t\in \II$.

If $\gamma\:[a,b]\to \spc{X}$ is a geodesic such that $p=\gamma(a)$, $q=\gamma(b)$, then we say that $\gamma$ is a geodesic from $p$ to $q$.
In this case, the image of $\gamma$ is denoted by $[p q]$\index{$[{*}{*}]$}, and, with abuse of notations, we also call it a \index{geodesic}\emph{geodesic}.
We may write $[p q]_{\spc{X}}$ 
to emphasize that the geodesic $[p q]$ is in the space  ${\spc{X}}$.

In general, a geodesic from $p$ to $q$ need not exist and if it exists, it need not  be unique.  
However, once we write $[p q]$ we assume that we have chosen such geodesic.

A \index{geodesic path}\emph{geodesic path} is a geodesic with constant-speed parameterization by the unit interval $[0,1]$.

A metric space is called \index{geodesic space}\emph{geodesic} if any pair of its points can be joined by a geodesic.

\parbf{Triangles.}
Given a triple of points $p,q,r$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$, a choice of geodesics $([q r], [r p], [p q])$ will be called a \index{triangle}\emph{triangle}; we will use the short notation 
$\trig p q r=\trig p q r_{\spc{X}}=([q r], [r p], [p q])$\index{$\trig {{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.

Given a triple $p,q,r\in \spc{X}$ there may be no triangle 
$\trig p q r$ simply because one of the pairs of these points cannot be joined by a geodesic.
Also, many different triangles with these vertices may exist, any of which can be denoted by $\trig p q r$.
If we write $\trig p q r$, it means that we have chosen such a triangle.

\section{Menger's lemma}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:mid>geod}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space.
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$, 
there is a midpoint~$z$.
Then $\spc{X}$ is a geodesic space.

\end{thm}

This lemma is due to Karl Menger \cite[Section 6]{menger}.

\parit{Proof.}
Choose $x,y\in \spc{X}$;
set $\alpha(0)=x$, and $\alpha(1)=y$.

Let $\alpha(\tfrac12)$ be a midpoint between $\alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(1)$.
Further, let $\alpha(\frac14)$ 
and $\alpha(\frac34)$ be midpoints between the pairs $(\alpha(0),\alpha(\tfrac12))$ 
and $(\alpha(\tfrac12),\alpha(1))$ respectively.
Applying the above procedure recursively,
on the $n$-th step we define $\alpha(\tfrac{k}{2^n})$,
for every odd integer $k$ such that $0<\tfrac k{2^n}<1$, 
as a midpoint of the already defined
$\alpha(\tfrac{k-1}{2^n})$ and $\alpha(\tfrac{k+1}{2^n})$.


This way we define $\alpha(t)$ for all dyadic rationals $t$ in $[0,1]$.
Moreover, $\alpha$ has Lipschitz constant $\dist{x}{y}{}$.
Since $\spc{X}$ is complete, the map $\alpha$ can be extended continuously to $[0,1]$.
Moreover,
\[\begin{aligned}
\length\alpha&\le \dist{x}{y}{}.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:eps-midpoint}
\]

\section{Model triangles and angles}


\parbf{Model triangles.}
Given three points $p,q,r$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$,
let us define its \index{model triangle}\emph{model triangle} $\trig{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{\tilde r}$ 
(briefly, 
$\trig{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{\tilde r}=\modtrig(p q r)_{\EE^2}$%
\index{$\modtrig$}) to be a triangle in the Euclidean plane $\EE^2$ such that
\begin{align*}\dist{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{\EE^2}&=\dist{p}{q}{\spc{X}},
&
\quad\dist{\tilde q}{\tilde r}{\EE^2}&=\dist{q}{r}{\spc{X}},
&
\quad\dist{\tilde r}{\tilde p}{\EE^2}&=\dist{r}{p}{\spc{X}}.
\end{align*}

The same way we can define the \index{hyperbolic model triangle}\emph{hyperbolic} and the \index{spherical model triangles}\emph{spherical model triangles} $\modtrig(p q r)_{\HH^2}$, $\modtrig(p q r)_{\SSS^2}$
in the Lobachevsky plane $\HH^2$ and the unit sphere~$\SSS^2$.
In the latter case, the model triangle is said to be defined if in addition
\[\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}< 2\cdot\pi.\]
In this case, the model triangle again exists and is unique up to an isometry of~$\SSS^2$.

\parbf{Model angles.}
If 
$\trig{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{\tilde r}=\modtrig(p q r)_{\EE^2}$ 
and $\dist{p}{q}{},\dist{p}{r}{}>0$, 
the angle measure of 
$\trig{\tilde p}{\tilde q}{\tilde r}$ at $\tilde p$ 
will be called the \index{model angle}\emph{model angle} of the triple $p$, $q$, $r$ and will be denoted by
$\angk p q r_{\EE^2}$%
\index{$\tilde\measuredangle$!$\angk{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.

The same way we define $\angk p q r_{\MM^2(\kappa)}$;
in particular, $\angk p q r_{\HH^2}$ and $\angk p q r_{\SSS^2}$.
We may use the notation $\angk p q r$ if it is evident which of the model spaces is meant.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:k-><mono}
Show that for any triple of point $p$, $q$, and $r$,
the function
\[\kappa\mapsto \angk p q r_{\MM^2(\kappa)}\]
is nondecreasing in its domain of definition.
\end{thm}


\section{Hinges and their angle measure}\label{sec:angles}

\parbf{Hinges.} Let $p,x,y\in \spc{X}$ be a triple of points such that $p$ is distinct from $x$ and~$y$.
A pair of geodesics $([p x],[p y])$ will be called  a \index{hinge}\emph{hinge} and will be denoted by 
$\hinge p x y=([p x],[p y])$\index{$\hinge{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$}.

\parbf{Angles.}The angle measure of a hinge $\hinge p x y$ is defined as the following limit
\[\mangle\hinge p x y=\lim_{\bar x,\bar y\to p} \angk p{\bar x}{\bar y},\]
where $\bar x\in\left]p x\right]$ and $\bar y\in\left]p y\right]$.

Note that if $\mangle\hinge p x y$ is defined, then
\[0\le \mangle\hinge p x y\le \pi.\]

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Suppose that in the above definition, one uses spherical or hyperbolic model angles instead of Euclidean.
Show that it does not change the value $\mangle\hinge p x y$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:undefined-angle}
Give an example of a hinge $\hinge p x y$ in a metric space with an undefined angle measure $\mangle\hinge p x y$.
\end{thm}

\section{Triangle inequality for angles}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
\label{claim:angle-3angle-inq}
Let  $[px_1]$, $[px_2]$, and $[px_3]$ be three geodesics in a metric space.
Suppose all the angle measures $\alpha_{i j}=\mangle\hinge p {x_i}{x_j}$ are defined.
Then 
\[\alpha_{13}\le \alpha_{12}+\alpha_{23}.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $\alpha_{13}\le\pi$, we can assume that $\alpha_{12}+\alpha_{23}< \pi$.
Denote by $\gamma_i$ the unit-speed parametrization of $[px_i]$ from $p$ to $x_i$.
Given any $\eps>0$, for all sufficiently small $t,\tau,s\in\RR_{\ge0}$ we have
\begin{align*}
\dist{\gamma_1(t)}{\gamma_3(\tau)}{}
&\le 
\dist{\gamma_1(t)}{\gamma_2(s)}{}+\dist{\gamma_2(s)}{\gamma_3(\tau)}{}<\\
&<
\sqrt{t^2+s^2-2\cdot t\cdot  s\cdot \cos(\alpha_{12}+\eps)} +
\\
&\quad+\sqrt{s^2+\tau^2-2\cdot s\cdot \tau\cdot \cos(\alpha_{23}+\eps)}\le
\end{align*}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{30 mm}
\vskip-6mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-615}
\vskip3mm
\end{wrapfigure}

Below we define 
$s(t,\tau)$ so that for 
$s=s(t,\tau)$, this chain of inequalities can be continued as follows:
\[\le
\sqrt{t^2+\tau^2-2\cdot t\cdot \tau\cdot \cos(\alpha_{12}+\alpha_{23}+2\cdot \eps)}.
\]

Thus for any $\eps>0$, 
\[\alpha_{13}\le \alpha_{12}+\alpha_{23}+2\cdot \eps.\]
Hence the result follows.

To define $s(t,\tau)$, consider three half-lines $\tilde \gamma_1$, $\tilde \gamma_2$, $\tilde \gamma_3$ on a Euclidean plane starting at one point, such that
$\mangle(\tilde \gamma_1,\tilde \gamma_2)\z=\alpha_{12}+\eps$,
$\mangle(\tilde \gamma_2,\tilde \gamma_3)\z=\alpha_{23}+\eps$,
and $\mangle(\tilde \gamma_1,\tilde \gamma_3)\z=\alpha_{12}\z+\alpha_{23}\z+2\cdot \eps$.
We parametrize each half-line by the distance from the starting point.
Given two positive numbers $t,\tau\in\RR_{\ge0}$, let $s=s(t,\tau)$ be 
the number such that 
$\tilde \gamma_2(s)\in[\tilde \gamma_1(t)\ \tilde \gamma_3(\tau)]$. 
Clearly, $s\le\max\{t,\tau\}$, so $t,\tau,s$ may be taken sufficiently small.
\qeds 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:adjacent-angles}
Prove that the sum of adjacent angles is at least $\pi$.

More precisely: suppose two hinges $\hinge pxz$ and $\hinge pyz$ are \index{adjacent hinges}\emph{adjacent};
that is, they share side $[pz]$, and the union of two sides $[px]$ and $[py]$ form a geodesic $[xy]$.
Show that
\[\mangle\hinge pxz+\mangle\hinge pyz\ge \pi\]
whenever  each angle on the left-hand side is defined.

Give an example showing that the inequality can be strict.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:first-var}
Assume that the angle measure of $\hinge q p x$ is defined.
Let $\gamma$ be the unit speed parametrization of $[qx]$ from $q$ to $x$.
Show that
\[\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{}
\le
\dist{q}{p}{}-t\cdot \cos(\mangle\hinge q p x)+o(t).\]

\end{thm}

\section{Gromov--Hausdorff convergence}

In this section, we cook up a metric space out of all compact metric spaces.
More precisely, we want to define the so-called  Gromov--Hausdorff metric on the set of \textit{isometry classes} of compact metric spaces.
(Being isometric is an equivalence relation, 
and an \index{isometry class}\emph{isometry class} is an equivalence class with respect to this relation.)

The obtained metric space will be denoted by $\GH$.
Given two metric spaces $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$,
denote by $[\spc{X}]$ and $[\spc{Y}]$ their isometry classes;
that is, $\spc{X}'\in [\spc{X}]$ if and only if $\spc{X}'\iso \spc{X}$.
Pedantically, the Gromov--Hausdorff distance from $[\spc{X}]$ 
to $[\spc{Y}]$ should be denoted as $|[\spc{X}]-[\spc{Y}]|_{\GH}$;
but we will write it as $|\spc{X}\z-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}$ and say (not quite correctly) that 
\textit{$|\spc{X}\z-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}$ is the Gromov--Hausdorff distance from  $\spc{X}$ 
to  $\spc{Y}$}.
In other words, from now on the term \textit{metric space} might also stand for its \textit{isometry class}.

The metric on $\GH$ is defined as the maximal metric such that \textit{the distance between subspaces in a metric space is not greater than the Hausdorff distance between them}.
Here is a formal definition:

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:GH}
The \index{Gromov--Hausdorff distance}\emph{Gromov--Hausdorff distance} $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}$ between compact metric spaces $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$
is defined by the following
relation.
 
Given  $r > 0$, we have that $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH} < r$ if and only if there exists a metric
space $\spc{W}$ and subspaces $\spc{X}'$ and $\spc{Y}'$ in $\spc{W}$ that are isometric to $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$
respectively such that $|\spc{X}'-\spc{Y}'|_{\Haus\spc{W}} < r$. 
(Here $|\spc{X}'-\spc{Y}'|_{\Haus\spc{W}}$ denotes the Hausdorff distance between sets $\spc{X}'$ and $\spc{Y}'$ in $\spc{W}$.)
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:GH-is-a-metric}
The set of isometry classes of compact metric spaces equipped with Gromov--Hausdorff metric forms a metric space (which is denoted by $\GH$).

In other words, for arbitrary compact metric spaces $\spc{X}$, $\spc{Y}$, and $\spc{Z}$ the following conditions hold

\begin{subthm}{GH-1} $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}\ge 0$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{GH-2} $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}=0$ if and only if $\spc{X}$ is isometric to $\spc{Y}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{GH-3} $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}=|\spc{Y}-\spc{X}|_{\GH}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{GH-4} $|\spc{X}-\spc{Y}|_{\GH}+|\spc{Y}-\spc{Z}|_{\GH}\ge |\spc{X}-\spc{Z}|_{\GH}$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

Note that \ref{SHORT.GH-1}, \ref{SHORT.GH-3},
and the if part of \ref{SHORT.GH-2} follow directly from \ref{def:GH}.
Parts \ref{SHORT.GH-4} and the only-if part of \ref{SHORT.GH-2} are not hard but require some work.
Complete proofs of these and the following statement  are given in \cite[Lecture 5
]{petrunin2023pure}.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:GH-complete}
The space $\GH$ is complete.
\end{thm}

The Gromov--Hausdorff metric defines Gromov--Hausdorff \index{Gromov--Hausdorff convergence}\emph{convergence}.
Namely, a sequence of compact metric spaces $\spc{X}_n$ converges to compact metric spaces $\spc{X}_\infty$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff if 
\[\dist{\spc{X}_n}{\spc{X}_\infty}{\GH}\to 0\quad\text{as}\quad n\to\infty.\]

This convergence is more important than the metric ---
in all applications, we use only the topology on $\GH$
and we do not care about the particular value of the Gromov--Hausdorff distance between spaces.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:surface-covergence}
Let $K_\infty,K_1,K_2,\dots$ be convex bodies in $\EE^3$ (compact convex sets with nonempty interiors).
Denote by $S_n$ the surface of $K_n$ with induced length metric.
Suppose $K_n\z\to K_\infty$ in the sense of Hausdorff.
Show that $S_n\to S_\infty$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.
\end{thm}
