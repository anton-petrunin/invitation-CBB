\section{Velocity of curve}

Let $\alpha$ be a curve in an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
If for any choice of 
geodesics $[p\,\alpha(t_0+\eps)]$ the vectors 
\[\tfrac{1}{\eps}\cdot\dist{p}{\alpha(t_0+\eps)}{}\cdot\dir p{\alpha(t_0+\eps)}\]
converge as $\eps\to 0+$, then their limit in $\T_p$ is called the \index{right derivative}\emph{right derivative} of $\alpha$ at $t_0$; it will be denoted by $\alpha^+(t_0)$.
In addition, $\alpha^+(t_0)\df0$
if $\tfrac{1}{\eps}\cdot\dist{p}{\alpha(t_0+\eps)}{}\to 0$ as $\eps\to 0+$.

The tangent vector $v=\dist px{}\cdot\dir px$ can be called \index{logarithm}\emph{logarithm} of $x$ at $p$ (briefly, \index{$v=\log_p x$ (logarithm)}$\log_p x$);
note that $\gamma^+(0)=\log_px$ for a geodesic path $\gamma$ from $p$ to $x$.\label{page:log}


\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:fa'=dfa'}
Let $\alpha$ be a curve in an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
Suppose $f$ a semiconcave Lipschitz function
defined in a neighborhood of $p\z=\alpha(0)$,
and $\alpha^+(0)$ is defined.
Then 
\[(f\circ\alpha)^+(0)
=
(\dd_pf)(\alpha^+(0)).\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Without loss of generality, we can assume that $f(p)=0$.
Suppose $f$ and therefore $\dd_pf$ are $L$-Lipschitz.

Choose a constant-speed geodesic $\gamma$ that starts from $p$,
such that the distance
$s=\dist{\alpha^+(0)}{\gamma^+(0)}{\T_p}$
is small.
By the definition of differential,
\[(f\circ\gamma)^+(0)=\dd_pf(\gamma^+(0)).\]

By comparison and the definition of $\alpha^+$,
\[\dist{\alpha(\eps)}{\gamma(\eps)}{\spc{L}}\le s\cdot\eps+o(\eps)\]
for $\eps>0$.
Therefore,
\[|f\circ\alpha(\eps)-f\circ\gamma(\eps)|\le L\cdot s\cdot\eps+o(\eps).\]

Suppose $(f\circ\alpha)^+(0)$ is defined.
Then
\[|(f\circ\alpha)^+(0)-(f\circ\gamma)^+(0)|\le L\cdot s.\]
Since $\dd_pf$ is $L$-Lipschitz, we also get 
\[|\dd_pf(\alpha^+(0))-\dd_pf(\gamma^+(0))|\le L\cdot s.\]
It follows that the needed identity holds up to error $2\cdot L\cdot s$.
The statement follows since $s>0$ can be chosen arbitrarily.

The same argument is applicable if in the place of $(f\circ\alpha)^+(0)$
we use any limit of $\tfrac1{\eps_n}\cdot [f\circ\alpha(\eps_n)-f(p)]$ for a sequence $\eps_n\to 0+$.
It proves that all such limits coincide; in particular, $(f\circ\alpha)^+(0)$ is defined and equals to $(\dd_pf)(\alpha^+(0))$.

\section{Gradient curves}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:grad-curve}
Let $f\:\spc{L}\subto\RR$ be a locally Lipschitz and semiconcave function on an Alexandrov space
$\spc{L}$.

A locally Lipschitz curve $\alpha\:[t_{\min},t_{\max})\to\Dom f$ will be called an \index{gradient curve}\emph{$f$-gradient curve} if
\[\alpha^+=\nabla_{\alpha} f;\]
that is, for any $t\in[t_{\min},t_{\max})$, $\alpha^+(t)$ is defined and 
$\alpha^+(t)=\nabla_{\alpha(t)} f$.
\end{thm}

A complete proof of the following theorem is given in \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2024}; 
it mimics the proof of the standard Picard theorem on the existence  and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary differential equations.
The uniqueness will follow from the first distance estimate (\ref{thm:dist-est}) proved in the next section.
We omit the proof of existence as it is rather lengthy.

\begin{thm}{Picard theorem}\label{thm:glob-exist-grad-curv}
Let $f\:\spc{L}\subto \RR$ be a locally Lipschitz and $\lambda$-concave function on an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
Then for any $p\in \Dom f$, there are unique $t_{\max}\in(0,\infty]$ and $f$-gradient curve $\alpha\:[0,t_{\max})\to \spc{L}$ with $\alpha(0)=p$ such that any sequence $t_n\to t_{\max}-$, the sequence $\alpha(t_n)$ does not have a limit point in $\Dom f$.
\end{thm}

Note that the theorem says that the future of a gradient curve is determined by its present, but it says nothing about its past.

Here is an example showing that the past is not determined by the present.
Consider the function $f\:x\mapsto -|x|$ on the real line $\RR$.
The tangent space $\T_x\RR$ can be identified with $\RR$.
Note that 
\[\nabla_xf=
\begin{cases}
1&\text{if}\quad x<0,
\\
0&\text{if}\quad x=0,
\\
-1&\text{if}\quad x>0.
\end{cases}
\]
So, the $f$-gradient curves go to the origin with unit speed and then stand there forever.
In particular, if $\alpha$ is an $f$-gradient curve that starts at $x$,
then $\alpha(t)=0$ for any $t\ge |x|$.

Here is a slightly more interesting example;
it shows that gradient curves can merge even in the region where $|\nabla f|\z\ne 0$.

\end{wrapfigure}

\begin{thm}{Example}
Consider the function $f\:(x,y)\mapsto-|x|-|y|$ on the $(x,y)$-plane.
Note that $f$ is concave;
its gradient field is sketched on the figure.

Let $\alpha$ be an $f$-gradient curve that starts at $(x,y)$ for $x>y>0$.
Then 
\[\alpha(t)=
\begin{cases}
(x-t,y-t) &\text{for}\quad 0\le t\le  x-y,
\\
(x-t,0) &\text{for}\quad x-y\le t\le  x,
\\
(0,0) &\text{for}\quad x\le t.
\end{cases}
\]

\end{thm}


\section{Distance estimates}

\begin{thm}{Observation}\label{eq:fist-var-inq+}
Let $\alpha$ be a gradient curve of a $\lambda$-concave function $f$ 
defined on an Alexandrov space.
Choose a point $p$; let $\ell(t)\df\distfun_p\circ\alpha(t)$ and $q=\alpha(t_0)$.
Then 
\[
\ell^+(t_0)\le -\left({f(p)}-{f(q)}-\tfrac\lambda2\cdot\ell^2(t_0)\right)/\ell(t_0)
\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\gamma$ be the unit-speed parametrization of $[qp]$ from $q$ to $p$, so $q=\gamma(0)$.
Then 
\begin{align*}
\ell^+(t_0)&=(\dd_q\distfun_p)(\nabla_qf)\le\tag{by \ref{clm:fa'=dfa'}}
\\
&\le -\langle\dir qp,\nabla_qf\rangle \le \tag{by \ref{ex:d(distfun):<}}
\\
&\le -\dd_qf(\dir qp)=\tag{by \ref{def:grad}}
\\
&=-(f\circ\gamma)^+(0)\le 
\\
&\le -\left({f(p)}-{f(q)}-\tfrac\lambda2\cdot\ell^2(t_0)\right)/\ell(t_0)
\end{align*}
The last two lines follow by
the definition of differential,
and concavity of $t\z\mapsto f\circ\gamma(t)-\tfrac \lambda2\cdot {t^2}$.
\qeds

Note that the following estimate implies uniqueness in the Picard theorem (\ref{thm:glob-exist-grad-curv}).

\begin{thm}{First distance estimate}\label{thm:dist-est}
Let $f$ be a $\lambda$-concave locally Lipschitz function on an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
Then
\[\dist{\alpha(t)}{\beta(t)}{}
\le 
e^{\lambda\cdot t}\cdot\dist[{{}}]{\alpha(0)}{\beta(0)}{}\]
for any $t\ge 0$ and any two $f$-gradient curves $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

Moreover, the statement holds for a locally Lipschitz $\lambda$-concave function defined in an open domain if there is a geodesic $[\alpha(t)\,\beta(t)]$ in $\Dom f$ for any~$t$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Fix a choice of geodesic $[\alpha(t)\,\beta(t)]$ for each $t$.
Let $\ell(t)=\dist{\alpha(t)}{\beta(t)}{}$. 
Note that
\[\ell^+(t)
\le-
\<\dir{\alpha(t)}{\beta(t)},\nabla_{\alpha(t)}f\>-\<\dir{\beta(t)}{\alpha(t)},\nabla_{\beta(t)}f\>
\le
\lambda\cdot\ell(t).\]
Here one has to apply \ref{eq:fist-var-inq+} for distance to the midpoint $m$ of $[\alpha(t)\,\beta(t)]$, then apply the triangle inequality and \ref{ex:monotonicity}.
Integrating, we get the result.

The following exercise describes a global geometric property of a gradient curve without direct reference to its function.
It is bases on the notion of \index{self-contracting curves}\emph{self-contracting curves} introduced by Aris Daniilidis, Olivier Ley, and St\'ephane Sabourau \cite{daniilidis-ley-sabourau}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:elf-contracting}
Let $f\:\spc{L}\subto\RR$ be a locally Lipschitz and concave function on an Alexandrov space
$\spc{L}$.
Then 
\[\dist{\alpha(t_1)}{\alpha(t_3)}{\spc{L}}\ge \dist{\alpha(t_2)}{\alpha(t_3)}{\spc{L}}.\]
for any $f$-gradient curve $\alpha$ and $t_1\le t_2\le t_3$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:mayer}
Let $f$ be a locally Lipschitz concave function defined on an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
Suppose $\hat\alpha\:[0,\ell]\to\spc{L}$ is an arc-length reparametrization of an $f$-gradient curve.
Show that $f\circ\hat\alpha$ is concave.
\end{thm}




The following exercise implies that gradient curves for a uniformly converging sequence of $\lambda$-concave functions converge to the gradient curves of the limit function.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{lem:fg-dist-est}
Let $f$ and $g$ be $\lambda$-concave locally Lipschitz functions on an Alexandrov space $\spc{L}$.
Suppose
$\alpha,\beta\:[0,t_{\max})\to \spc{L}$ are respectively $f$- and $g$-gradient curves.
Assume $|f-g|<\eps$; let $\ell\:t\mapsto\dist{\alpha(t)}{\beta(t)}{}$.
Show that
\[\ell^+\le \lambda\cdot\ell+\tfrac{2\cdot\eps}{\ell}.\]

Conclude that if $\alpha(0)=\beta(0)$ and $t_{\max}<\infty$, then
\[\dist{\alpha(t)}{\beta(t)}{}
\le
\Const\cdot\sqrt{\eps\cdot t}\]
for some constant $\Const=\Const(t_{\max},\lambda)$.
\end{thm}

\section{Gradient flow}

Let $\spc{L}$ be an Alexandrov space 
and $f$ be a locally Lipschitz semiconcave function defined on an open subset of $\spc{L}$.
If there is an $f$-gradient curve $\alpha$ such that $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(t)=y$,
then we will write 
\[\GF^t_f(x)=y.\]
The partially defined map $\GF^t_f$ from $\spc{L}$ to itself is called the \index{gradient flow}\emph{$f$-gradient flow} for time $t$.
Note that
\[\GF^{t_1+t_2}_f=\GF_f^{t_1}\circ\GF_f^{t_2}.\]
In other words, one may think that gradient flow is a partial action of the \textit{semigroup} $(\RR_{\ge0},+)$ on the space.
 
From the first distance estimate \ref{thm:dist-est}, 
it follows that for any $t\ge 0$, the domain of definition of $\GF^t_f$ is an open subset of $\spc{L}$.
In some cases, it is globally defined.
For example, if $f$ is a $\lambda$-concave function defined on the whole space $\spc{L}$, then $\GF^t_f(x)$ is defined for all $x\in \spc{L}$ and $t\ge0$;
see \cite[16.19]{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2024}.

Now let us reformulate the statements about gradient curves obtained earlier using this new terminology.
From the first distance estimate, we have the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:GF-is-lip}
Let $\spc{L}$ be an Alexandrov space 
and $f\:\spc{L}\to \RR$ be a semiconcave function.
Then the map $x\mapsto\GF^t_f(x)$ is locally Lipschitz.

Moreover, if $f$ is $\lambda$-concave, then $\GF^t_f$ is $e^{\lambda\cdot t}$-Lipschitz.
\end{thm}

The next proposition follows from \ref{lem:fg-dist-est}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{grad-curve-conv}
Let $\spc{L}$ be an Alexandrov space.
Suppose $f_n\:\spc{L}\z\to\RR$ is a sequence of
$\lambda$-concave functions 
that converges to $f_\infty\:\spc{L}\to \RR$. 
Then for any $x\in \spc{L}$ and $t\ge 0$, we have
\[\GF_{f_n}^t(x)\to \GF_{f_\infty}^t(x)\]
as $n\to \infty$.
\end{thm}

There is a more general version of this proposition for a converging sequence $\spc{L}_n\to \spc{L}_\infty$ of spaces and converging sequence of functions $f_n\:\spc{L}_n\z\to\RR$; see \cite[16.21]{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2024}.

\section{Gradient exponent}\label{gexp}

One of the technical difficulties in Alexandrov's geometry comes from
nonextendability of geodesics. 
In particular, the exponential map, $\exp_p\:\T_p\to \spc{L}$, if defined in the usual way, can
be undefined in an arbitrary small neighborhood of the origin. 

Next we construct the \index{gradient exponential map}\emph{gradient exponential map} 
\[\gexp_p\:\T_p\to\spc{L},\]
which essentially solves this problem. 
It shares many properties with the ordinary exponential map, and better in certain respects,
even in the Riemannian universe.

Let $\spc{L}$ be Alexandrov's space and $p\in \spc{L}$, consider the function $f\z=\distfun_p^2/2$.
Recall that $\Phi^t_{f}$ denotes the gradient flow.
Let us define the \textit{gradient exponential map} as the limit
\[\gexp_p(v)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\Phi^{t_n}_{f}(x_n),\]
where the sequences $x_n\in \spc{L}$ and $t_n\ge 0$ are chosen so that $t_n\to\infty$
and $e^{t_n}\cdot\log_px_n\to v$ as $n\to\infty$.

More intuitively, suppose $i_{\lambda}\:\lambda\cdot \spc{L}\to \spc{L}$ sends a point in the rescaled copy $\lambda\cdot\spc{L}$ to the corresponding point in $\spc{L}$.
By the first distance estimate (\ref{thm:dist-est}), the map
$$\Phi^t_{f}\circ i_{e^t}\:e^t\cdot \spc{L}\to \spc{L}\eqlbl{eq:gexp}$$ 
is short for any $t\ge 0$.
If we have a pointed Gromov--Hausdorff convergence $(e^{t_n}\cdot \spc{L},p)\to (\T_p,o_p)$,
then $\gexp_p\:\T_p\to \spc{L}$ is the limit of $\Phi^{tn}_{f}\circ i_{e^{t_n}}$.
This way we get that $\gexp_p$ is short as a limit of short maps.
This observation generalized in the following proposition. 


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:gexp}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a proper $\Alex0$ space.
Then for any $p\in \spc{L}$ the gradient exponent $\gexp_p\:\T_p\to\spc{L}$ is uniquely defined.
Moreover, $\gexp_p$ is a short map and 
\[\gexp_p(\gamma^+(0))=\gamma(1)\]
for any geodesic path $\gamma$ that starts at $p$.
\end{thm}

The last statement implies that 
\[\gexp_p\circ\log_p=\id,\]
so it is appropriate to use term \textit{exponent} for $\gexp$.


\parit{Proof.} 
Note that $f''\le 1$.
Since the space is proper we can choose a limit in \ref{eq:gexp}.

Let $\gamma$ be a geodesic that stats at $p$.
Observe that $\gamma\circ\ln$ is an $f$-gradient curve.
By the first distance estimate, we have that $\Phi^t_{f}$ is an $e^t$-Lipschitz.
It implies any limit in \ref{eq:gexp} has the same value;
that is $\gexp_p$ is uniquely defined.

Applying again the $\Phi^t_{f}$ is an $e^t$-Lipschitz, we get that $\gexp_p$ is a short map
\qeds

\section{Remarks}

The gradient flow was developed to prove the existence of quasigeodesics with given initial data \cite{perelman-petrunin:qg,petrunin:qg, petrunin:survey}, but it turned out that gradient flow and gradient exponent is a more useful technical tool in Alexandrov geometry.


For general curvature bound $\kappa$, the construction of gradient exponent has to be modified;
it is denoted by $\gexp_p^\kappa$ \cite[16.36]{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2024}.

For $\kappa=-1$ we have 
and $\gexp_p(\gamma^+(0))=\gamma(1)$
for any geodesic path $\gamma$ that starts at $p$
and 
\[\dist{\gexp_p^{-1}v}{\gexp_p^{-1}w}{\spc{L}}\le \side\hinge0vw_{\HH^2}.\]

Similarly, for $\kappa=1$ we have $\gexp_p(\gamma^+(0))=\gamma(1)$
for any geodesic path $\gamma$ that starts at $p$ and 
\[\dist{\gexp_p^{1}v}{\gexp_p^{1}w}{\spc{L}}\le \side\hinge0vw_{\SSS^2},\]
but this time all this holds only if $|v|,|w|\le\tfrac\pi2$ and $\length\gamma\le\pi$.

The gradient exponential map $\gexp_p$  for a point $p$ a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ coincides with the Riemannian exponential map inside the cut locus of $p$ but \emph{is different } from the  Riemannian exponential outside it.
The following statement shows that this technique can prove something nontrivial even fro Riemannian manifolds.

\begin{thm}{Propbem}
Let $(M,g)$ be a complete $m$-dimensional Riemannian with sectional curvature at least $1$.
Assume $M$ is not homeomorphic to $\SSS^m$.
Show that there is a short onto map $\SSS^m\to (M,g)$.
\end{thm}
