\chapter*{Preface}

This book is similar to our ``Invitation to Alexandrov geometry'' written jointly with Stephanie Alexander \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2019}.
We try to demonstrate the beauty and power of Alexandrov geometry by reaching interesting applications and theorems with minimal preparation.
This time we do spaces with curvature bounded below in the sense of Alexandrov.
We extensively use another book of us with Stephanie Alexander \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin2024}.

This subject is more technical; it takes more preparation, and we had to jump over some proofs.
Namely, we do not prove the existence part in generalized Picard's theorem (\ref{thm:glob-exist-grad-curv})
and Perelman's theorem about conic neighborhoods (\ref{thm:spherical-nbhd});
the rest is nearly rigorous.
Some important statements stated as exercises, but they are solved in hints at the end of the book.

\medskip 

In Lecture~\ref{chap:prelim}, we discuss necessary preliminaries and fix notations.

Lecture~\ref{chap:defs} introduces the main object of our study --- spaces with curvature bounded below in the sense of Alexandrov.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:globalization}, we formulate and prove the globalization theorem that local Alexandrov condition implies global.
To simplify the presentation we consider only the compact case, this case gives the main ideas of the proof but is less technical.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:derivative}, we do beginning of calculus --- tangent space and space of directions, differential, and gradient.

Lecture~\ref{chap:GF} introduces gradient flow, which will be further used as the main technical tool.

Lecture~\ref{chap:splitting} proves the line splitting theorem.
Furthermore, we introduce and study  linear subspaces of tangent spaces.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:dim}, we introduce linear dimension and volume.
Further, we prove the Bishop--Gromov inequality and the right-inverse theorem,
introduce  distance charts, and show that all reasonable types of dimension are the 
same for Alexandrov spaces.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:lim} we show that a lower curvature bound survives under Gromov--Hausdorff limits and prove Gromov's selection theorem.
Further, we present Perelman's construction of strictly concave functions and apply it with Gromov's selection theorem to prove the homotopy finiteness theorem.
This proof illustrates one of the main sources of applications of Alexandrov geometry.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:bry}, we introduce the boundary of finite-dimensional Alexandrov spaces and prove the doubling theorem.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:L/G}, we show that quotients of Alexandrov spaces by isometric group action are Alexandrov spaces.
This gives another source of applications of Alexandrov geometry, several examples are given.

In Lecture~\ref{chap:convex-body}, we show that the surface of a convex body in Euclidean space is an Alexandrov space.
This theorem was proved by Alexandrov himself and provides third (historically first) source of applications of Alexandrov geometry.

Finally, Appendix~\ref{chap:embedding} sketches Alexandrov's embedding theorem of convex polyhedra.
This theorem is the first remarkable result in Alexandrov geometry, dating back to 1941.
The proof is very well written by Alexandrov, but we decided to include its sketch here due to its beauty and importance.
This appendix was written by Nina Lebedeva and the second author for  for a book about St. Petersburg mathematicians and their discoveries \cite{lebedeva-petrunin2024a}.

Let us give a list of available texts on Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The 2-dimensional theory is treated in the classical book of Alexandr Alexandrov \cite{alexandrov-1948}.
\item The first introduction to Alexandrov geometry of all dimensions is given in the original paper by Yuriy Burago, Michael Gromov, and Grigory Perelman \cite{burago-gromov-perelman} 
and its extension \cite{perelman1991} written by Perelman.
\item A brief and reader-friendly introduction was written by Katsuhiro Shiohama \cite[Sections 1--8]{shiohama}.
\item Another reader-friendly introduction, written by Dmitri Burago, Yuriy
Burago, and Sergei Ivanov \cite[Chapter 10]{burago-burago-ivanov}.
\item Survey by Conrad Plaut \cite{plaut:survey}.
\item Survey by the second author \cite{petrunin:survey}.
\end{itemize}
