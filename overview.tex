\chapter{Surfaces}\label{chap:surfaces}

This lecture is less rigorous;
its aim is to give a glimpse into the geometry of convex surfaces, the main precursor to modern Alexandrov geometry.
For a deeper dive into this theory, we recommend the classic and brilliantly written books by Alexandr Alexandrov \cite{alexandrov, alexandrov-1948}.
Additionally, the book by Alexey Pogorelov \cite{pogorelov1969} is highly recommended, despite being a challenging read.


\section{Polyhedral surfaces}

A \index{polyhedral surface}\emph{polyhedral surface} is defined as a 2-dimensional manifold (possibly with boundary) equipped with a length metric such that there is a finite triangulation with each triangle isometric to a Euclidean triangle.
A \index{triangulation}\emph{triangulation} of a polyhedral surface is always assumed to satisfy this condition.

Note that, according to our definition, every polyhedral surface is compact.

Consider a point $p$ on a polyhedral surface $\spc{P}$.
We can assume that $p$ is a vertex of a triangulation of $\spc{P}$,
which can be achieved by subdividing the triangulation.
Let $\theta_p$ denote the \emph{total angle} around $p$, which is the sum of all angles at $p$ in the triangles that have $p$ as a vertex.

Note that $\theta_p$ is independent of the choice of triangulation.
If $p$ is an interior point, then the value $2\cdot\pi-\theta_p$ is called the \emph{curvature} at $p$.
If $p$ lies on the boundary of $\spc{P}$, then the value $\pi-\theta_p$ is called the \emph{inner turn} at $p$.

A point with nonzero curvature or inner turn will be called an \emph{essential vertex} of the surface.
Note that an essential vertex is a vertex in any triangulation.

\begin{thm}[!]{Exercise}\label{ex:geodesic-vertex}
Show that geodesics on a polyhedral surface with nonnegative curvature and nonnegative inner turns can have essential vertices only at their endpoints.
\end{thm}

The following statement is an analog of the Gauss--Bonnet formula.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:gauss-bonnet}
Let $\spc{P}$ be a polyhedral surface.
Denote by $K(\spc{P})$ and $T(\spc{P})$ the sum of the curvatures at all interior points
and the sum of the inner turns at all boundary points of $\spc{P}$, respectively.
Show that
\[
K(\spc{P}) + T(\spc{P}) = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot \chi(\spc{P}),
\]
where $\chi(\spc{P})$ denotes the Euler characteristic of $\spc{P}$.
\end{thm}

The following proposition states that the new definition of curvature is consistent with the $\Alex0$ comparison.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:poly-CBB}
A polyhedral surface is $\Alex0$ if and only if it has nonnegative curvature at every interior point and nonnegative inner turn at each boundary point.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By \ref{comp-kappa}, it is sufficient to check that
$f=\tfrac12\cdot\distfun_p^2\circ\gamma$ is 1-concave for any geodesic $\gamma$ and any point $p$.

We can assume that $p$ is not a vertex and that the endpoints of $\gamma$ are not vertices;
the case where $p$ or the endpoints of $\gamma$ are vertices can be handled by approximation.
By \ref{ex:geodesic-vertex}, $\gamma$ does not contain any vertices.



Given a point $x=\gamma(t_0)$, choose a geodesic $[px]$.
Again, by \ref{ex:geodesic-vertex}, $[px]$ does not contain any vertices.
Therefore, a neighborhood $U \supset [px]$ can be unfolded onto a plane;
that is, there exists an injective length-preserving map $z \mapsto \tilde z$
of $U$ into the Euclidean plane.
It maps a neighborhood of $x$ in $\gamma$ to a line segment $\tilde \gamma$.
Let
\[\tilde f(t) \df \tfrac12 \cdot \distfun_{\tilde p}^2 \circ \tilde \gamma(t).\]
Since the geodesic $[px]$ maps to a line segment, we have $\tilde f(t_0) = f(t_0)$.
Furthermore, since the unfolding map $z \mapsto \tilde z$ preserves the lengths of curves, we obtain
$\tilde f(t) \ge f(t)$ if $t$ is close to $t_0$.
That is, $\tilde f$ is a local upper barrier for $f$ at $t_0$; see \ref{Function comparison}.
Evidently, $\tilde f''(t) \equiv 1$.
Therefore, $f$ is 1-concave.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:poly-CBB}
The converse is left to the reader.\qeds
\end{thm}

\section{Approximation}

The following theorem is a key additional tool in the Alexandrov geometry of surfaces.
We will use this result in the proof of \ref{cor:Alex0-convex} to reduce questions about $\Alex0$ surfaces to polyhedral surfaces with nonnegative curvature.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:approximation}
Any closed $\Alex0$ surface is a Gromov--Hausdorff limit of homeomorphic polyhedral surfaces with nonnegative curvature.
\end{thm}

We will give only a sketch of proof, but the sketch is not short.
First we apply the following exercise in constructing an approximation $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ of a given surface $\spc{P}$;
It reduces the theorem to saying that this is indeed an approximation (\ref{clm:approximation}).
Further, we use couple of deep results (\ref{thm:cont-vol} and \ref{thm:vol-short}) to prove the claim.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:construction}
Let $\spc{P}$ be a closed $\Alex0$ surface.

\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:nbhd}
Show that any point $p$ admits an arbitrarily small closed convex polygonal neighborhood $N$;
that is, $N$ is convex and bounded by a broken geodesic.

\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:triangulation}
Given $\delta>0$, show that $\spc{P}$ admits a triangulation $\tau$ by convex triangles
with positive inner turn at each vertex and diameter smaller than $\delta$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:poly}
Suppose that $v$ is a vertex of a triangulation $\tau$ of $\spc{P}$ by convex triangles.
Let $\theta_v$ be the sum of angles at $v$ in all the triangles of~$\tau$.
Show that $\theta_v\le 2\cdot\pi$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\parit{Construction.}
Let $\spc{P}$ be a closed $\Alex0$ surface.
By part \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:triangulation}, we can triangulate $\spc{P}$ by small convex triangles, say diameter of each triangle is less than given $\delta>0$.
Now, replace each triangle in the triangulation with its corresponding model solid triangle, and denote the resulting polyhedral surface by $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$.

Note that $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ is homeomorphic to $\spc{P}$;
moreover, there exists a homeomorphism $\spc{P} \to \tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ that maps each point $x \in \spc{P}$ to a point $\tilde{x} \in \tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ in the corresponding model triangle.

By the hinge comparison (\ref{angle}) and part \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:poly} of the exercise, the total angle around each vertex in $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ does not exceed $2\cdot\pi$.
Thus, the resulting polyhedral surface $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ has nonnegative curvature.

\medskip

Observe that Theorem \ref{thm:approximation} follows from the following statement.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:approximation}
If $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ is provided by the construction, then $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta\to\spc{P}$ as $\delta\to 0$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.
\end{thm}

This claim looks self-evident, but it is not.
A remarkably elegant proof was given by Alexandrov \cite[VII §~6]{alexandrov-1948}.
We will outline an alternative proof based on the following exercise and two theorems, which will be stated without proof.

The first theorem is due to Yuri Burago, Mikhael Gromov, and Grigori Perelman \cite[10.8]{burago-gromov-perelman};
it generalizes Alexandrov's theorem for surfaces \cite[X §~2]{alexandrov-1948}.
The second theorem is due to Nan Li \cite{li}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:cont-vol}
Let $\spc{X}_1, \spc{X}_2,\dots$ be a sequence of $n$-dimensional $\Alex\kappa$ spaces that converges to $\spc{X}_\infty$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.
Then $n$-volumes on $\spc{X}_i$ weakly converge to the $n$-volume on $\spc{X}_\infty$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:vol-short}
Let $\spc{X}$ be an Alexandrov space without boundary, and let $\spc{Y}$ be an arbitrary Alexandrov space.
Then any short volume-preserving map $\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ is an isometry.
\end{thm}

Suppose a convex solid triangle $\Delta$ in an $\Alex0$ surface has angles $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
Let us define its excess by
\[\excess\Delta=\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi.\]
Since the angles of a model triangle sum up to $\pi$, by the hinge comparison (\ref{angle}),
the excess is nonnegative.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:approximation}
Let $\tau$ be a triangulation of a closed $\Alex0$ surface $\spc{P}$ by convex triangles $\Delta_1,\dots,\Delta_n$.


%\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:diangle}
%Let $\Upsilon$ be a topological disc in $\tilde{\spc{P}}$ bounded by a geodesic $\gamma_0$ and local geodesic $\gamma_1$ with common endpoints.
%Let $\omega$ be the sum of the curvatures of points in $\Upsilon$.
%Show that
%\[\cos \omega\cdot \length \gamma_1\le \length \gamma_0\]
%if $\omega<\pi$.
%\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:excess}
Show that
\[\excess\Delta_1+\dots+\excess\Delta_n \le 2\cdot\pi\cdot \chi(\spc{P}),\]
where $\chi(\spc{P})$ denotes the Euler characteristic of $\spc{P}$.
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:length}
Let $x$ and $y$ be points on the sides of a triangle $\Delta_i$, and let $\tilde x$ and $\tilde y$ be the corresponding points in the corresponding triangle $\tilde \Delta$ in $\tilde{\spc{P}}$.
Show that
\[\dist{\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\tilde \Delta}\le\dist{x}{y}{\Delta}\le \dist{\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\tilde \Delta}+\excess\Delta\cdot \diam \Delta.\]

\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:approximation:area}
Let $\Delta$ be a solid triangle in the triangulation $\tau$ of $\spc{P}$, and let $\tilde \Delta$ be the corresponding triangle in $\tilde{\spc{P}}$.
Show that
\[\area \tilde \Delta\le \area \Delta\le \area \tilde \Delta+\tfrac12\cdot\excess\Delta\cdot (\diam \Delta)^2.\]

\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

Note that part \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:excess} implies that $\chi(\spc{P})\ge 0$.
Therefore, $\spc{P}$ is homeomorphic to a sphere, projective plane, torus, or Klein bottle.
In the latter two cases, the construction produces a flat surface $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$, which has to be isometric to $\spc{P}$.
Therefore the cases of sphere, projective plane are more interesting.

\parit{Proof of \ref{clm:approximation}.}
Choose a sequence of positive numbers $\delta_n\to0$;
let $\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}$ be polyhedral surfaces provided by the construction and let $\tau_n$ be the corresponding triangulation.

According to part \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:length} of the exercise, the spaces $\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}$ have bounded diameter.
Therefore by Gromov's selection theorem, we can pass to a converging sequence of $\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}$;
denote its Gromov--Hausdorff limit by $\tilde{\spc{P}}$.
If $\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta}$ does not converge to $\spc{P}$, then we can assume that $\tilde{\spc{P}}$ is not isometric to $\spc{P}$.

Choose two points $x,y\in \spc{P}$, and connect them by a geodesic.
Denote by $s_1,\dots,s_m$ the points of the geodesic on the sides of the triangulation $\tau_n$;
we assume that these points appear in the same order on the geodesic.
Denote by $\tilde x$, $\tilde y$, and $\tilde s_1,\dots,\tilde s_m$ the corresponding points in $\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}$.
By part \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:length} of the exercise,
\[\dist{\tilde s_{i-1}}{\tilde s_i}{\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}}\le\dist{s_{i-1}}{s_i}{\spc{P}}.\]
Note also that
\[\dist{\tilde x}{\tilde s_1}{\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}}\le \delta_n
\quad\text{and}\quad
\dist{\tilde s_m}{\tilde y}{\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}}\le \delta_n
\]
Therefore
\[\dist{\tilde x}{\tilde y}{\tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}}\le\dist{x}{y}{\spc{P}}+2\cdot\delta_n.\]

Passing to the limit, we get a short onto map $\spc{P}\to \tilde{\spc{P}}$.
On the other hand, applying parts \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:excess} and \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:area}, we get that
\[
\area \spc{P} -\pi\cdot\chi(\spc{P})\cdot \delta_n^2
\le
\area \tilde{\spc{P}}_{\delta_n}
\le
\area \spc{P}
\]
By Theorem \ref{thm:cont-vol}, $\area \spc{P}= \area \tilde{\spc{P}}$.
Applying Theorem \ref{thm:vol-short}, we get that the short map $\spc{P}\to \tilde{\spc{P}}$ is an isometry --- a contradiction.
\qeds

\parit{Remark.}
The main difficulty in the proof comes from nonconvexity of triangles in the triangulation of $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$.
If these triangles would be convex, then the first estimate in parts \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:length} and \ref{SHORT.ex:approximation:excess} would imply that $\tilde{\spc{P}}_\delta$ is close to $\spc{P}$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.













\section{Surface of polyhedrons and bodies}

Let us define a \index{convex body}\emph{convex body} as a compact convex subset in $\EE^3$ with a nonempty interior.
The \index{surface}\emph{surface} of a convex body is defined as its boundary equipped with the induced length metric.

\begin{thm}[!]{Exercise}\label{ex:surf-S2}
Show that the surface of a convex body is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional sphere.
\end{thm}

A \index{convex polyhedron}\emph{convex polyhedron} is a convex body with a finite number of extremal points, called its \index{vertex}\emph{vertices}.

Note that the surface of a convex polyhedron $K$ is a closed polyhedral surface.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{pr:tetrahedron}
Assume that the surface of a nondegenerate tetrahedron $T$ has curvature $\pi$ at each of its vertices.
Show that

\begin{subthm}{pr:tetrahedron:=}
all faces of $T$ are congruent;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{pr:tetrahedron:perp} the line containing the midpoints of opposite edges of $T$ intersects these edges at right angles.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:total-angle}
The surface $\spc{P}$ of any convex polyhedron $K$ has nonnegative curvature.
Moreover, a point $v$ is a vertex of $K$ if and only if
$v$ is an essential vertex of $\spc{P}$.
\end{thm}

A proof of this claim canbe found in the school textbook \cite[§ 48]{kiselev-stereo-en};
one can also deduce it from \ref{claim:angle-3angle-inq}.

\begin{thm}[!]{Exercise}\label{ex:surface-covergence}
Let $K_1,K_2,\dots,$ and $K_\infty$ be convex bodies in $\EE^m$.
Denote by $\spc{P}_n$ the surface of $K_n$.
Suppose $K_n\z\to K_\infty$ in the sense of Hausdorff.
Show that $\spc{P}_n\to \spc{P}_\infty$ in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff.
\end{thm}

Since any convex body is a Hausdorff limit of a sequence of convex polyhedrons, the next proposition follows from \ref{prop:poly-CBB}, \ref{ex:surface-covergence}, and \ref{thm:CBB-closed}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:conv-surf-CBB(0)}
The surface of a convex body in $\EE^3$ is $\Alex0$.
\end{thm}

\section{Uniqueness theorem}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:alexandrov-uni'}
Any two convex polyhedrons in $\EE^3$ with isometric surfaces are congruent.

Moreover, any isometry between the surfaces of convex polyhedrons can be extended to an isometry of the whole $\EE^3$.
\end{thm}

If one assumes that the isometry between the surfaces is face-to-face,
then we get an equivalent reformulation of Cauchy's theorem.
Cauchy's argument, with a small addition, proves \ref{thm:alexandrov-uni'}.

First, let us remind Cauchy's proof, assuming the reader knows it.
If not, then read it in one of the classical texts \cite{aigner-zigler,dolbilin,tabacnikov-fuks}.

\parit{Sketch of Cauchy's proof.}
Suppose $K$ and $K'$ are convex polyhedrons in $\EE^3$;
denote their surfaces
by $\spc{P}$ and $\spc{P}'$.
Suppose there is an isometry $\iota\:\spc{P}\to \spc{P}'$ that sends each face of $K$ to a face of $K'$.

Let us mark an edge of $K$ with ``$+$'' (or ``$-$'') if the dihedral angle at this edge in $K$ is smaller (respectively, bigger) than the corresponding angle in $K'$.
Further, we consider the  graph $\Gamma$ that is formed by all marked edges.
If $\Gamma$ is empty, then Cauchy's theorem follows; assume the contrary.

The graph $\Gamma$ is embedded into $\spc{P}$, which is homeomorphic to the sphere.
In particular, the edges coming from one vertex have a natural cyclic order.
Given a vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, we can count the \textit{number of sign changes} around $v$;
that is, the number of consequent pairs of edges with different signs.

We need to show two statements:

\begin{thm}{Local lemma}
At any vertex of $\Gamma$, the number of sign changes is at least $4$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Global lemma}
No (nonempty) planar graph meets the condition of the local lemma.
\end{thm}

Once the lemmas are proved, Cauchy's theorem follows.
\qeds

Once more, the argument above is  written only to make sure we are on the same page;
it will not work without reading the actual proof.

\parit{Alexandrov's addition.}
We need to remove the assumption that the isometry $\iota\:\spc{P}\z\to \spc{P}'$ is face-to-face.
Mark in $\spc{P}$ all the edges of $K$ as we did above.
In addition, if an edge in $K'$ does not correspond to an edge of $K$, then mark its inverse image in $K$   with ``$-$''; these lines on $K$ will be referred to as \index{fake edges and vertices}\emph{fake edges}.

The marked lines divide $\spc{P}$ into regions, and the restriction of $\iota$ to each region is a rigid motion.
A vertex of the obtained graph can be a vertex of $K$, or it can be a {}\emph{fake vertex};
that is, it might be an intersection of an edge and a fake edge (as $v$ in the picture).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-50}
\vskip-0mm
\end{figure}

For a usual vertex, the local lemma can be proved the same way.
For a fake vertex $v$, it is easy to see that both parts of the edge coming thru $v$ are marked with minus
while both of the fake edges at $v$ are marked with plus.
Therefore, we still have at least four sign changes at $v$.
The remaining argument works as before.
\qeds

Let us also state the following result of Alexey Pogorelov \cite[chapter III]{pogorelov};
an alternative proof was found by Yurii Volkov \cite{volkov1968}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Any two convex bodies in $\EE^3$ with isometric surfaces are congruent.

Moreover, any isometry between surfaces of convex bodies can be extended to an isometry of the whole $\EE^3$.
\end{thm}

Notice that the statement is equivalent to the following:
\textit{It follow if any two polyhedra $K$ and $K'$  with close surfaces in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff would be almost congruent};
that is, there is a motion $\mu$ of $\EE^3$ such that the Hausdorff distance from $K$ to $\mu(K')$ is small.
At first glance, this theorem might look like a small improvement of Alexandrov's uniqueness,
but this improvement is huge, and the proof is quite hard.




\section{Existence theorem}

By \ref{prop:poly-CBB}, \ref{clm:total-angle}, and \ref{ex:surf-S2}, the surface of a convex polyhedron is an $\Alex0$ and homeomorphic to the sphere.
Alexandrov's theorem states that the converse holds if one includes in the consideration \textit{twice covered polygons}.
In other words, we have to consider a plane polygon as a degenerate polyhedron;
in this case, its surface is defined as the doubling of the polygon across its boundary.

From now on, we assume that a polyhedron can degenerate to a plane polygon.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:alexandrov-first}
A polyhedral metric on the two-sphere is isometric to the surface of a convex polyhedron (possibly degenerate) if and only if it has nonnegative curvature.

\end{thm}

Applying this theorem with the approximation theorem (\ref{thm:approximation}) and \ref{ex:surface-covergence}, we get the following statement.
Here we again assume that a convex body can degenerate to a convex plane figure,
and, in this case, its surface is defined as the doubling of the figure across its boundary.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:Alex0-convex}
A metric on the two-sphere is $\Alex0$ if and only if it is isometric to the surface of a convex body (possibly degenerate).

\end{thm}

The proof of the existence theorem will be discussed in the following two sections.
It is instructive to solve the following exercise before going further.

\begin{thm}[!]{Exercise}\label{ex:alexandrov=<4}
Let $\spc{P}$ be the 2-sphere equipped with a polyhedral metric with nonnegative curvature.

\begin{subthm}{ex:alexandrov=<4:>=3}
Prove that $\spc{P}$ has at least 3 essential vertices.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:alexandrov=<4:=3}
If $\spc{P}$ has exactly 3 essential vertices $u$, $v$, and $w$, then it is isometric to the doubling of the solid model triangle $\modtrig(uvw)$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{ex:alexandrov=<4:4}
If $\spc{P}$ has exactly 4 essential vertices, then it is isometric to the surface of a tetrahedron (possibly degenerate to a quadrangle).
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\section{Reformulation}

In this section, we introduce several notions and use them to reformulate the existence theorem (\ref{thm:reformulation}).

\paragraph{Space of polyhedrons.}
Let us denote by $\bm{K}$ the space of all convex polyhedrons in the Euclidean space,
including polyhedrons that degenerate to a plane polygon.
Polyhedrons in $\bm{K}$ will be considered up to a motion of the space; we will not distinguish between a convex polyhedron and its congruence class.

The space $\bm{K}$ will be considered with the topology induced by the {}\emph{Hausdorff metric up to a motion};
that is, the distance between (congruence classes of) polyhedrons $K$ and $L$ is defined by
\[\dist{K}{L}{}\df \inf_\mu \{\dist{K}{\mu(L)}{\Haus}\},\]
where $\mu$ runs among all motions of $\EE^3$.

We say that a polyhedron $K$ in $\bm{K}$ has \emph{no symmetries} if  $K\z\ne \mu(K)$ for any nontrivial motion $\mu$ of $\EE^3$.
The set of all polyhedrons without symmetry in $\bm{K}$ will be denoted by $\bm{K}^\circ$.
Observe that $\bm{K}^\circ$ is an open set in $\bm{K}$.

Further, denote by $\bm{K}_n$ the polyhedrons in $\bm{K}$ with exactly $n$ vertices, and let $\bm{K}_n^\circ=\bm{K}_n\cap \bm{K}^\circ$.
Since any polyhedron has at least 3 vertices, the space $\bm{K}$ admits a subdivision into a countable number of subsets $\bm{K}_3,\bm{K}_4,\dots$

\paragraph{Space of surfaces.}
The space of polyhedral surfaces with nonnegative curvature that are homeomorphic to the 2-sphere will be denoted by $\bm{P}$.
The surfaces in $\bm{P}$ will be considered up to an isometry, and the whole space $\bm{P}$ will be equipped with the natural topology induced by the Gromov--Hausdorff metric.

We say that a surface $\spc{P}$ in $\bm{P}$ has \emph{no symmetries} if there is no nontrivial isometry
$\mu\:\spc{P}\to \spc{P}$.
The set of all surfaces without symmetry in $\bm{P}$ will be denoted by $\bm{P}^\circ$.
Observe that $\bm{P}^\circ$ is an open set in $\bm{P}$.

The subset of $\bm{P}$ of all surfaces with exactly $n$ essential vertices will be denoted by $\bm{P}_n$; let $\bm{P}_n^\circ=\bm{P}_n\cap \bm{P}^\circ$.
By \ref{ex:alexandrov=<4:>=3}, any surface in $\bm{P}$ has at least 3 essential vertices.
Therefore $\bm{P}$ is subdivided into countably many subsets
 $\bm{P}_3,\bm{P}_4,\dots$

\paragraph{From a polyhedron to its surface.}
Recall that the surface of a convex polyhedron is a sphere with nonnegative curvature.
Therefore, passing from a polyhedron to its surface we define a map
\[\iota\:\bm{K}\to \bm{P}.\]

The existence theorem (\ref{thm:alexandrov-first}) follows from the next statement.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:reformulation}
For any integer $n\ge 3$,
the map $\iota$ defines a bijection from $\bm{K}_n$ to~$\bm{P}_n$.
\end{thm}

\section{About the proof of existence}

By \ref{ex:surface-covergence}, the map $\iota\:\bm{K}\to\bm{P}$ is continuous.
Combining \ref{clm:total-angle} with the uniqueness theorem (\ref{thm:alexandrov-uni'}), we get that $\iota(\bm{K}_n)\subset \bm{P}_n$ and the map $\iota\:\bm{K}_n\to\bm{P}_n$ is injective.
It remains to prove the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}\label{clm:surjective}
For any $n\ge 3$, the map $\iota\:\bm{K}_n\to\bm{P}_n$ is surjective.
\end{thm}

The proof is based on the construction of a one-parameter family of polyhedrons that starts at an arbitrary polyhedron
and ends at a polyhedron with its surface isometric to the given surface $\spc{P}$.
This type of argument is called the \index{continuity method}\emph{continuity method}; it is often used in the theory of differential equations.

\medskip

Now let us get into details.
First, observe that the second part of the uniqueness theorem (\ref{thm:alexandrov-uni'}) implies that $\iota(\bm{K}_n^\circ)\subset \bm{P}_n^\circ$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:connected}
For any integer $n\ge 4$, the space $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ is connected and dense in $\bm{P}_n$.
\end{thm}

Note that $\bm{P}_3^\circ=\emptyset$;
indeed the surface of a triangle admits a reflection symmetry.
The case $n=4$ can be deduced from \ref{ex:alexandrov=<4:4}; thus, we can assume that $n\ge 5$.

The density of $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ in $\bm{P}_n$ follows from a general-position-type argument.

The proof of the first statement is not complicated, but it requires ingenuity;
it can be done by the direct construction of a one-parameter family of surfaces in $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ that connects two given surfaces.
Such a family can be obtained by concatenating the following elementary deformations (direct or reversed).

Start with a surface $\spc{P}$ from $\bm{P}_n^\circ$.
Suppose $v$ and $w$ are essential vertices in $\spc{P}$.
Let us cut $\spc{P}$ along a shortest path from $v$ to~$w$.
This way we obtain a sphere with a hole.
The hole can be patched by a family of patches so that the obtained surface remains in $\bm{P}_n$;
in other words, the surface remains to have exactly $n$ essential vertices.
(After the patching, the vertices $v$ and $w$ may become inessential.
There is a three-parameter family of such patches, so we have something to choose from.)
Choosing a one-parameter family of such patches, we can get an elementary deformation of~$\spc{P}$.

Again, applying a general-position-type argument to the above construction, we get a path in $\bm{P}_n^\circ$, assuming that the starting and ending surfaces are in $\bm{P}_n^\circ$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:open}
The map $\iota\:\bm{K}_n^\circ\to\bm{P}_n^\circ$ is open;
that is, it maps any open set in $\bm{K}_n^\circ$ to an open set in $\bm{P}_n^\circ$.

In particular, for any $n\ge 3$, the image $\iota(\bm{K}_n^\circ)$ is open in~$\bm{P}_n^\circ$.
\end{thm}

This statement follows from the so-called \index{invariance of domain}\emph{invariance of domain theorem},
which states that a \textit{continuous injective map between manifolds of the same dimension is open}.

Recall that $\iota$ defines a continuous and injective $\bm{K}_n^\circ\to\bm{P}_n^\circ$.
It remains to check that both spaces $\bm{K}_n^\circ$ and $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ are $(3\cdot n-6)$-dimensional manifolds.

Choose a polyhedron $K$ in $\bm{K}_n$.
It is uniquely determined by the $3\cdot n$ coordinates of its $n$ vertices.
We can assume that the first vertex is at the origin,
the second has a positive $x$-coordinate
and the remaining two coordinates vanish,
and the third has a vanishing $z$-coordinate and a positive $y$-coordinate.
Therefore, all polyhedrons in $\bm{K}_n$ that lie sufficiently close to $K$ can be described by $3\cdot n-6$ parameters.
If $K$ has no symmetries, then this description is one-to-one;
in this case, a neighborhood of $K$ in $\bm{K}_n$ admits a parametrization by an open set in $\RR^{3\cdot n-6}$.

The case of surfaces is analogous.
We need to construct a subdivision of the sphere into plane triangles using only essential vertices.
By Euler's formula, there are exactly $3\cdot n-6$ edges in this subdivision.
The lengths of the edges completely describe the surface $\spc{P}$ and any surface nearby.
If the surface has no symmetries, then this description is one-to-one, and a neighborhood of $\spc{P}$ in $\bm{P}_n$ admits a parametrization by an open set in  $\RR^{3\cdot n-6}$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:closed}
The map $\iota\:\bm{K}_n\to\bm{P}_n$ is closed;
that is, the image of a closed set in $\bm{K}_n$ is closed in $\bm{P}_n$.

In particular, for any $n\ge 3$, the set $\iota(\bm{K}_n)$ is closed in~$\bm{P}_n$.
\end{thm}

Choose a sequence of polyhedrons $K_1,K_2,\ldots\in\bm{K}_n$.
Assume that the sequence $\spc{P}_i=\iota(K_n)$ converges in $\bm{P}_n$ as $i\to \infty$;
denote its limit by $\spc{P}_\infty$.
We need to construct a polyhedron $K_\infty\in \bm{K}_n$ such that $\iota(K_\infty)=\spc{P}_\infty$;
let us do it.

Passing to a subsequence, we can assume that $K_i$ converges in $\bm{K}$ as $i\to\infty$;
denote the limit polyhedron by $K_\infty$.
Since $\iota$ is continuous, $\iota(K_i)$ converges to $\iota(K_\infty)$ in~$\bm{P}$; so, $\iota(K_\infty)=\spc{P}_\infty$.
Recall that $\iota(\bm{K}_m)\z\subset\bm{P}_m$ for each $m$; therefore, $K_\infty\in \bm{K}_n$.


\parit{Proof of \ref{clm:surjective}.}
The case $n\le 4$ is already solved in \ref{ex:alexandrov=<4}; so we assume that $n\ge 5$.
By \ref{lem:closed} and \ref{lem:open},
$\iota(\bm{K}_n^\circ)$ is a nonempty closed and open set in $\bm{P}_n^\circ$, and $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ is connected.
Therefore, $\iota(\bm{K}_n^\circ)=\bm{P}_n^\circ$.

By \ref{lem:closed}, $\iota(\bm{K}_n)$ is closed in $\bm{P}_n$.
By \ref{lem:connected}, $\bm{P}_n^\circ$ is dense in $\bm{P}_n$.
Since $\iota(\bm{K}_n^\circ)=\bm{P}_n^\circ$, we have $\bm{P}_n^\circ\subset \iota(\bm{K}_n)$;
therefore, $\iota(\bm{K}_n)=\bm{P}_n$;
that is, $\iota\:\bm{K}_n\z\to\bm{P}_n$ is surjective.

\section{Ambient space}

On one hand, Alexandrov's surface theory is simpler since it has extra tools.
On the other hand, these tools come with extra structure, which makes the theory more complicated.
The following result of Joseph Liberman \cite{liberman} gives an example.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Any geodesic in the surface of a convex body is one-sided differentiable as a curve in $\EE^3$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\gamma$ be a geodesic on the surface of a convex body $K$.
Choose $p\in K$.
By \ref{ex:liberman} (which is Liberman's lemma), the function $f_p\:t\mapsto \distfun_p\circ\gamma(t)$ is semiconcave for any $p\in K$.
In particular, one-sided derivatives $f_p^\pm(t)$ are defined for every $t$.

Given $x=\gamma(t)$, choose three points $p_1,p_2,p_3\in K$ in general position;
that is, the points $x$, $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ do not lie in one plane.
Observe that the distance functions $\distfun_{p_i}$ give smooth coordinates in a neighborhood of $x$.
From above the functions $f_{p_i}$ have one-sided derivatives at $t$.
Since the coordinates are smooth, we get that $\gamma^+(t)$ is defined as well.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:convex}
Suppose a plane $\Pi$ cuts from the surface of a convex body $K$ a disc $\Delta$, and the reflection of $\Delta$ across $\Pi$ lies in $K$.
Show that $\Delta$ is a convex subset of the surface;
that is, if a geodesic has endpoints in $\Delta$, then it completely lies in $\Delta$.
\end{thm}

}

The following exercise gives a more exact version of comparison for convex surfaces;
it is due to Anatolii Milka \cite[Theorem 2]{milka1982}.

\begin{thm}{Very advanced exercise}\label{ex:milka}
Let $\spc{P}$ be the surface of a nondegenerate convex body $K\subset\EE^3$,
and let $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ be geodesic paths in $\spc{P}$ that start at one point $p\z=\gamma_1(0)\z=\gamma_2(0)$.
Suppose $x_i=\gamma_i(1)$, and $y_i\z=p+\gamma_i^+(0)$.
Show that
\[\dist{x_1}{x_2}{\spc{P}}\le \dist{y_1}{y_2}{W},\]
where $W$ denotes the complement to the interior of $K$.

\end{thm}



\section{Remarks}

The excess of solid triangles can be extended to a sigma-additive measure on Borel subsets of $\Alex\kappa$ surface.
This is the so-called \index{curvature measure}\emph{curvature measure} \cite[V]{alexandrov-1948}.
There have been several attempts to generalize this to higher dimensions, but so far, we only have partial results; see \cite{gigli2018, lebedeva-petrunin2024b} and the references therein.

Big part of the theory described in this lecture is generalized to surfaces with bounded integral curvature \cite{alexandrov-zalgaller,reshetnyak1993}.

The statement of Cauchy's theorem was conjectured by Adrien-Marie Legendre in the first edition of his geometry textbook \cite{legendre}.
It was motivated by a vague definition in Euclid's Elements, which could be interpreted as
\textit{polyhedrons are equal if their faces are pairwise equal}.
The local lemma was already known to Legendre.
Joseph-Louis Lagrange, a colleague of Legendre, suggested this problem to Augustin-Louis Cauchy who soon solved it \cite{cauchy}.

The observation that the face-to-face condition can be removed was made by
Alexandr Alexandrov in 1941; in the same paper he proved the uniqueness theorem \cite{alexandrov-1941}.
A quite different proof was found by Yurii Volkov in his thesis \cite{volkov}; it uses a deformation of three-dimensional polyhedral space.
(Be aware that the proof of this theorem given in the book by Igor Pak contains an essential mistake \cite{petrunin-2023}.)

In Cauchy's proof \cite{cauchy}, it was deducted from an analog of the following lemma.
Cauchy made a small mistake in its proof that was fixed in a century \cite{sabitov}.
Several proofs of the arm lemma can be found in the letters between Isaac Schoenberg and Stanisław Zaremba \cite{schoenberg-zaremba}.

\begin{thm}{Arm lemma}\label{lem:arm}
Assume that $A=[a_0 a_1\dots a_n]$ is a convex polygon in $\EE^2$
and $A'=[a'_0 a'_1\dots a'_n]$ is a polygonal line in $\EE^3$
such that
$|a_i-a_{i+1}|=|a'_i-a'_{i+1}|$ for any $i\in\{0,\dots,n-1\}$
and
$\measuredangle a_i\le \measuredangle a'_i$
for each $i\in\{1,\dots,n-1\}$.
Then
$$|a_0-a_n|\le |a'_0-a'_n|$$
and equality holds if and only if $A$ is congruent to $A'$.
\end{thm}

The following variation of the arm lemma is due to Viktor Zalgaller \cite{zalgaller};
it makes sense for nonconvex spherical polygons and can be used instead of the standard arm lemma.

\begin{thm}{Another arm lemma}
Let $A=[a_1\dots a_n]$ and $A'\z=[a'_1\z\dots a'_n]$ be two spherical $n$-gons (not necessarily convex).
Assume that $A$ lies in a half-sphere,
the corresponding sides of $A$ and $A'$ are equal,
and each angle of $A$ is at least the corresponding angle in $A'$.
Then $A$ is congruent to~$A'$.
\end{thm}

Another close relative of the arm lemma is Reshetnyak's majorization theorem \cite{reshetnyak}.

Alexandrov gave two proofs of the global lemma \cite[2.1.2 and 2.1.3]{alexandrov}.
The first is combinatorial, and the second is more visual.
The argument in the second proof was reused by Anton Klyachko in his \index{car-crash lemma}\emph{car-crash lemma} \cite{klyachko}.

Proposition \ref{prop:conv-surf-CBB(0)} generalizes to the boundaries of convex bodies  in $\EE^m$ for any $m\ge 2$.
It could be considered as a partial case of the conjecture about the boundary of Alexandrov space; see \ref{conj:bry}.
Another partial case, for convex sets in Riemannian manifolds, is proved by Stephanie Alexander and $\tfrac23$ authors \cite{alexander-kapovitch-petrunin-2008}.

According to the uniqueness theorem, a convex polyhedron is completely defined by the intrinsic metric of its surface.
In particular, knowing the metric, we could find the position of the edges.
However, in practice, it is not easy to do.
For example, the surface glued from a rectangle, as shown in the picture, defines a tetrahedron.
Some of the glued lines appear inside the facets of the tetrahedron, and some edges (dashed lines) do not follow the sides of the rectangle.
